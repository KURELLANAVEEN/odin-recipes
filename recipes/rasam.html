    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Rasam is a spicy South Indian soup.[1] While it is sometimes served on its own as a soup, it is usually served as a side for rice (food). In a traditional South Indian meal, it is part of a course that includes sambar rice and curd rice</p>
    </p> Rasam has a distinct taste in comparison to sambar due to its own seasoning ingredients and is fluid in consistency. Chilled prepared versions are marketed commercially as well as rasam paste in bottles.[2]</p>
